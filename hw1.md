# Homework 1
*Homework 1 due September 8, 9 pm ET*

- Using Generative AI, complete either (a) the game you started in class on 2 September, including a nontrivial computer play algorithm; or (b) the service built on a public API you started in class on 4 September.
- You should check in your program to GitHub. For this assignment, you should create your own personal GitHub account and a private GitHub repository named below.
- Authorize course staff to see the repository (TBD).
- This video shows how to [integrate GitHub with Bolt](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CH1wEdmwM2vFN_-HX4u28m2JyYfRYbyk/view?usp=sharing) 
- And this video to [deploy to Netlify]
(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-DNqmhi2eg)
- Your program should rely only on easily downloadable dependencies. To test this, create a new Netlify deployment environment, clone the GitHub repo into it, and run it according to your instructions. Please provide a way to reach you if we get stuck building your submission.
- Deploy your program to Netlify using the Bolt integration.
- You may work with one partner (as a team of 2) if you desire. We expect twice as much work from teams of 2. Team grades will be shared.
Submission Instructions:

*DO NOT WAIT UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO SET UP YOUR GITHUB INTEGRATIONS. TEST THEM AHEAD OF TIME SO YOU DON'T RUN OUT OF TIME SUBMITTING.*

- Please submit your CS1060 GitHub repository URL.
It should be https://github.com//cs1060--hw1
- In a `README` file, include:
  - the full name(s) of the contributor(s) including yourself, their GitHub usernames and Harvard email addresses
  - Bolt URL, GitHub repository URL, and Netlify deployment URL
  - what you worked on, any issues you encountered, and how many hours it took you.
- For redundancy, you may also upload your code as a zip file of the folder to Google Drive and include a link in your README file.
- If you haven't, please fill out the survey to provide feedback on your first project: [https://bit.ly/cs1060survey]()
- **Canvas will not allow you to submit multiple ways at once.**
 

## Basic rubric: 50 points total

### Implementation: 40 points
- Anything submitted (broken, does not load): 10/40
- Doesn’t work properly (loads, but does not work): 20/20
- Works properly (loads and works, with noticeable bugs): 30/40
- Works great (web API or improved game, minor or no bugs): 40/40
- For games, "nontrivial computer play algorithm" is assumed in the above; reasonable attempt -0; trivial attempt -3; no attempt -5

### Deployment: 10 points

- Successful deployment to Netlify -0; broken attempt -5; no deployment attempt visible -10
- –1 point for any material missing piece in the README file

**Ideal: Shareable work that works on Bolt and Netlify, and great interface: (50/50)**
